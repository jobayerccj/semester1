                       We realize there are virtually hundreds of choices out there when deciding who to list your home with and which firm will conduct your estate sale.  
                       However, Yellow Bird and Our Real Estate team brings you an extreme advantage of a tremendous marketing blitz to advertise both the contents and the home at the same time.
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                    Ask any realtor you interview, "How many people will actually look at your advertising on our home within two weeks?  How many showings do you expect in the first 2 weeks? How many potential buyers will attend your average open house?"   
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                       Then ask us:
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                       How many people will actually look at the advertisement with photographs & description in the first two weeks?  1000 to 3000 plus.
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                       How many showings in the first two weeks?  We want to sell your home with fewer than 10 private showings; usually the home sells at the Estate Sale.
                   </p>
                   
                   <p>
                       How many potential buyers will attend your average open house? Minimum of 100's as our open house is your Estate Sale as well as the first showing of the home. 
                       We also invite hundreds of Realtors to come through specifically to look at the property.
